# Memetic Algorithm for the ATSP

## Improvement strategies

- [ ] GPX crossover
- [ ] Greedy subtour recombination
- [ ] Improved LSO operators 
- [ ] Variable Neighbourhood search
- [ ] Candidates from Minimum-Cost Arborescence
- [ ] Pheromone-guided local search (enhance edge candidates with pheromones)
- [ ] Diversification? Restart?
